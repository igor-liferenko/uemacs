C-xC-d the same as ESC-z
C-s starts search as ESC, and make repeated searches by simply pressing C-s again, exit search via C-m or C-g depending on whether you need to stay on current point or roll back to the search starting point
C-j produces <NL> in search mode instead of C-m
----------------
turn uemacs to CWEB: each module is `@*'-section and everything
must be in one file - uemacs.w, without using header files, and
turn all comments into doc-sections (`@ '), print it and start
reading and writing more documentation along the way for more
understanding

save cursor on exit like in
https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/saveplace.el
or see source code of jmacs or vim

use code which implements '-g' option in uemacs to restore cursor on launch

implement UTF-8 search

see TTY for info on job control
